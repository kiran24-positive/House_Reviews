Worst thing would be the door being on the side of the house, rather being at the large open doors at the back, which meant during summer it was a bit annoying.","?Sep 21, 2020 11?36 AM","?Sep 9, 2020",t aylorsl3@cardiff.ac.uk,??,,5,

It’s slightly out of the centre of cathays which wasn’t an issue but would have been nice. It was a nice modern

Worst bit would be how small the house was for 9 people, some rooms got freezing and the white floor in the kitchen was a pain to clean.","?Sep 21, 2020 11?48 AM","?Sep 9, 2020",leyshoncm@cardiff.ac.uk,??,,4,
